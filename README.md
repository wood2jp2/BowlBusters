So you think you're a quite the bowler, huh? You've rolled more turkeys than Thanksgiving Day? This app allows you to keep track of your own bowling game, and will calculate your final score for you. This sleek app is powered by React, bootstrapped up by create-react-app, and styled using package 'styled-components'. After working with styled-components for the first time, I found it delightful and surprisingly straight-forward. No more CSS files needed! Check it out: https://www.styled-components.com/

DIRECTIONS: Enter your bowler alias, and gets to rolling! Strikes (knocking all pins down on the first roll of any frame) are denoted in the first box of each frame with a capital 'X'. You will then leave the second roll box blank. Spares (knocking down all that is left of the ten pins on the second roll) are denoted with a slash '/'. If you get a spare or strike in the tenth frame, add your bonus rolls by clicking the button! One extra roll for a spare, and two for a strike.
